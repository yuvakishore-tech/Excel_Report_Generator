Project Title
Excel Report Generator

Project Description
The Excel Report Generator is a Python application designed to automate the creation of Excel reports
from CSV files. Manual report creation in Excel is time-consuming and repetitive. This project reduces
manual effort by automatically generating summaries, pivot tables, and charts.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to convert structured CSV data into a professional Excel report
with minimal user interaction.

Workflow
1. The user launches the application.
2. The user selects a CSV file using the file upload dialog.
3. The program reads the CSV file using pandas.
4. Missing values are removed to ensure clean data.
5. Numeric columns are identified automatically.
6. Summary statistics such as total, average, minimum, and maximum are calculated.
7. A pivot table is created by grouping data and applying aggregation.
8. A bar chart is generated using matplotlib.
9. An Excel file is created with multiple sheets.
10. The chart is embedded into the Excel report.
11. The final Excel file is saved to the user-selected location.

Modules Used:
Pandas is used for data reading, cleaning, and analysis.
Matplotlib is used to generate charts.
Openpyxl is used to create and format Excel files.
Tkinter is used to build the graphical user interface.


Limitations:
The application supports only CSV files.
Only one numeric column is processed at a time.
The pivot table structure is fixed.
Large datasets may affect performance.


Future Enhancements:
Support for Excel and JSON files.
User selection of numeric columns.
Multiple aggregation options.
Additional chart types.
Improved user interface design.


Conclusion:
This project demonstrates practical usage of Python libraries for data analysis and automation.
It is useful for learning file handling, data processing, and report generation in real-world scenarios.
